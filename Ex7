TITLE: INHERITANCE 
Code: To create a player class and to inherit the classes Cricker_player, Football_player and Hockey_player from player class
// Base class
class Player {
    String name;
Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Player Name: " + name);
    }
}

// Cricket player class
class Cricket_Player extends Player {
    Cricket_Player(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Cricket Player: " + name);
    }
}

// Football player class
class Football_Player extends Player {
    Football_Player(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Football Player: " + name);
    }
}

// Hockey player class
class Hockey_Player extends Player {
    Hockey_Player(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Hockey Player: " + name);
    }
}

// Main class
public class PlayerDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cricket_Player c = new Cricket_Player("Virat");
        Football_Player f = new Football_Player("Messi");
        Hockey_Player h = new Hockey_Player("Manpreet");

        c.display();
        f.display();
        h.display();
    }
}

OUTPUT: 
Cricket Player: Virat
Football Player: Messi
Hockey Player: Manpreet

Time Complexity:
Object Creation (Constructors) → O(1) (constant time)
Display Method Calls → O(1) (just printing data)
Overall Time Complexity → O(1)

Space Complexity:
Each object stores only a few fields (like name, role, team etc.) → constant space
No extra data structures used
Overall Space Complexity → O(1)


Worst Case Scenario:
Even if you create many player objects, each object takes constant time and space individually.
Worst case is creating a large number of players → still linear growth in memory (O(n) if n players are created).
For a single program run (like in the given example with only 3 players), it is O(1).
